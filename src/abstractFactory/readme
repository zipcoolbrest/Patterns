Usage example:
Abstract factory creates cross-platform interface elements and ensures
that they correspond to the selected operating system.
A cross-platform program can show the same interface elements that
look a little different on different operating systems.
In such a program, it is important that all the elements created always
correspond to the current operating system. You wouldn't want a program
running on Windows to suddenly start showing macOS-style checkboxes

Example:
1. create device interfaces like tv and phone
2. create device factory where we can create devises
3. realise it:
    3.1 create several companies (for example LG and Samsung);
    3.2 create in companies devices and implement it from interfaces (point 1);
    3.3 create in companies device factory and implement it from interfaces (point 2);
done.
